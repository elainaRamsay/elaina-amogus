bodyCentreX = 200
bodyCentreY = 170

hitbox is from bodyCentreX-150, bodyCentreY-120 to bodyCentreX+100, bodyCentreY+120

define bodyWidth, bodyHeight vars
use them lol

bodyWidth included the backpack
uninclude it? maybe

refactor the whole fakcing thing after figuring out each value
maybe go OOP for it, should be less garbly
